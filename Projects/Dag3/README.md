Description: The aims of the Dutch Microbiome Project are to establish gut microbiome patterns associated with health, to identify microbial pathobionts in disease, either specific or shared across multiple diseases (such as gastrointestinal, metabolic and neurological disorders), and to determine how genetics, host characteristics, the exposome including early-life exposures, lifestyle, and environment shape healthy, and disease-associated microbiota.
