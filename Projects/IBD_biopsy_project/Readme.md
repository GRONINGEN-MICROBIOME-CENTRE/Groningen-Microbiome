# Mucosal hostâ€“microbe interactions associate with clinical phenotypes in inflammatory bowel disease

This project is aiming to identify intestinal gene expression and microbiota change in repsect to the heterogeneity of IBD. We also want to highlight that considering the host-microbiota interactions would reveal more novel insights into the disease putative mechanisms compared solely with transcriptomic or microbial data.
