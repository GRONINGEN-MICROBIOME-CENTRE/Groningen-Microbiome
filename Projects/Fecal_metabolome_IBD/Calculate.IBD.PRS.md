# A simple calculation of IBD poly genetic risk score


*extracted IBD GWAS from public database*

Database is https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ (reference:https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3760#Sec12)

ebi-a-GCST004132 is CD

ebi-a-GCST004133 is UC

ebi-a-GCST004131 is IBD


*match SNPs/SNP-proxy in our genetics dataset*

241 indepedent-variants in total from the largest GWAS (Europe+Asian) so far. However, 13 variants can't find back in our genetics data (WES+GSA), of which six have proxies. The rest of seven varaints or their proxy are not found due to the low allele frequency in European populations.
