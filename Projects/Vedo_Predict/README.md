Description: The aim of this project is to predict vedolizumab treatment response based on the metagenomes and proteomic data derived from 50 patients with IBD.
Furthermore, since feacal and blood samples have been collected before and 14 weeks after start vedolizumab treatment, we aimed to identify longitudinal gut microbial and proteomic changes during vedolizumab treatment in relation to clinical response.
